# T.A. Engineering Webapp

This is a modern, multi-page static website for T.A. Engineering, built with HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and JavaScript. The project is organized for easy extension and customization.

## Structure
- `src/` — Main source folder for HTML, CSS, and JS
  - `index.html` — Home page
  - `services.html` — Services page
  - `about.html` — About Us page
  - `contact.html` — Contact page
  - `css/main.css` — Shared custom styles
  - `js/main.js` — Shared JavaScript
- `public/` — For static assets (images, etc.)

## Usage
Open any HTML file in the `src` folder in your browser. All pages share a consistent header, footer, and styling. Update the header/footer in each file for global changes, or refactor to use includes if using a static site generator.

## Customization
- Replace placeholder content and images as needed.
- Add more pages by copying the structure of existing HTML files.
- Tailwind is included via CDN for rapid prototyping.
